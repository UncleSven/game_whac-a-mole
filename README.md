## General setup

The first time before you play the game, you need to build the Docker image and run the Docker container by executing
the `make up` command.

If you no longer want to play, you can easily dismantle the Docker container and image by executing `make down`.

## Play the game

After you have run the **_general setup_**, you can play the game by entering the url `localhost:8000` in your browser.

Every time you want, you can stop the game by executing `make end` and restart it with executing `make fun`.
